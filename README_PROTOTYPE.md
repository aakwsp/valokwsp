valokwsp discord bot prototype
==============================

this bot is a prototype for the future valokwsp discord bot. the purpose of this version is to test core features before full integration with the riot games api.

currently, we do not have access to riot's production api and are operating in a prototype environment until approval is received. once api access is granted, the bot will transition to a full release including match tracking, rr updates, and player performance features.

features planned:
- track valorant match rr gains/losses
- notify friends when someone starts a match
- performance summaries after each game
- player stats + seasonal history
- optional web dashboard integration

temporary prototype focus:
- command structure
- message formatting + ui behavior
- performance and logging
- internal utilities

this is not the final version. more features and structure will be added once riot api access is fully approved.
